**cheerBot team:**

 - [Tobias Christen][1]
 - [Mikael H. MÃ¸ller][2]

Hardware
-------
The cheerBot is based on the [sumo bot][5] with a couple of cheering arms attached to the front. The cheering arms are built using:

 - 2 T-Pro Mini Servo SG-90 9G Servos
 - A hand full of neon cable ties
 - 6 wooden popsicle sticks
 - Some stiff wire to make the arm joints.

The cheering arms design is based on this neat [hack][6].

Software
--------
The happiness inside cheerBot is build using johnny-five for interaction wiht the hardware and keypress for controlling via the keyboard.
